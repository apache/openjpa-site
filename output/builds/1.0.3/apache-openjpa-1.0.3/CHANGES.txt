Overview

   These notes describe the difference between OpenJPA release 1.0.3 and the
   preceding releases 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2. 1.0.3 is a maintenance release
   and contains primarily bugfixes.

   OpenJPA is a feature-rich implementation of the persistence part of Java
   Community Process JSR-220 (Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0), which is known as
   the Java Persistence API (JPA). OpenJPA can be used as a stand-alone POJO
   persistence layer, or it can be integrated into any EJB3.0 compliant
   container and many lightweight frameworks. This release of OpenJPA is 100%
   compliant with the JPA specification.
