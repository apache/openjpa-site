We're using the Jenkins build server for continuous builds for several of
the OpenJPA code streams and some of the artifacts in the Tools subproject.

### Email Notifications

Email notifications to commits@openjpa are generated by Jenkins for build
failures and when builds are back to normal.


### Jenkins Info

If you're interested in the Jenkins services or would like to request an
account on the server, checkout the [Jenkins wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/general/Hudson)
 for more information.	The builds.apache.org server uses the Apache LDAP
for authentication, just like repository.apache.org and issues.apache.org.
